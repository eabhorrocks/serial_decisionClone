## A python-toolbox for modelling inter-trial dependencies in psychophysical data ##

This repository contains code to reproduce the analyses in
Fr端nd, Wichmann, Macke (2014): Quantifying the effect of inter-trial dependence on perceptual decisions. J Vis, 14(7): 9.

The repository is organized as follows:
* *intertrial* is a folder that contains an actual python library that can do  the relevant computations. You can use this library to analyze your own data.
* *data* contains the data that were used in the paper
* *examples* contains working code examples.

This code reproduces the analyses in the paper

## Updated by Anke Braun and Anne Urai, 2017: Additional functionality ##

The code as originally provided by Fr端nd et al  is adapted to allow for a modulatory term, that on a trial-by-trial basis interacts with experimental history.
When the data file contains a sixth column, this will be taken as a modulation factor (e.g. pupil) and multiplied with response and stimulus history at every lag.
Figures display both the main history kernels and the interaction kernels.

## Updated by Jakob Macke, 2016: Additional theory on Abrahamyan et al ##

Abrahamyana et al recently published an article on  ``Adaptable history biases in human perceptual decisions''

(Arman Abrahamyan, Laura Luz Silva, Steven C. Dakin, Matteo Carandini, and Justin L. Gardner; Adaptable history biases in human perceptual decisions, PNAS).

In addition to showing that history biases are adaptable, they used simulations to relate the strength of history bias to the resulting drop in visual sensitivity. 
We were excited to see this, because our theoretical results on the relationship between history bias and drop in sensitivity precisely capture (and, indeed, predict) their results--
