This repository contains code to replicate the analyses in

Fründ, Wichmann, Macke (2014): Quantifying the effect of inter-trial dependence on perceptual decisions. J Vis, in press.

The repository is organized as follows:

* *intertrial* is a folder that contains an actual python library that can do
  the relevant computations. You can use this library to analyze your own
  data.
* *data* contains the data that were used in the paper
* *examples* contains working code examples. In particular, there is code to
  replicate some of the analyses in the paper.
