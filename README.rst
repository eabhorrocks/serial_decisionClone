The code as originally provided by Fr端nd et al (see below) is adapted to allow for a modulatory term, that on a trial-by-trial basis interacts with experimental history.
When the data file contains a sixth column, this will be taken as a modulation factor (e.g. pupil) and multiplied with response and stimulus history at every lag.
Figures display both the main history kernels and the interaction kernels.

This repository contains code to reproduce the analyses in
Fr端nd, Wichmann, Macke (2014): Quantifying the effect of inter-trial dependence on perceptual decisions. J Vis, 14(7): 9.

The repository is organized as follows:
* *intertrial* is a folder that contains an actual python library that can do
  the relevant computations. You can use this library to analyze your own
  data.
* *data* contains the data that were used in the paper
* *examples* contains working code examples.
