The data are described in our paper as:

"Finally, we analysed data from a study by Jäkel and Wichmann (2006). From
this study, we analysed data from six observers, five naive at the beginning
of the experiment and one highly trained observer. For each observer, we
analysed between 2.640 and 5.665 spatial 2-AFC trials, i.e. a total of 27.060
trials. The signal was randomly presented either left or right of the
fixation cross. The assignment of the signal to the left or right position
did not depend on signal positions in previous trials."

These data are provided as a matrix with colums
