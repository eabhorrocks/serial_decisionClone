This folder contains data that are kindly shared by Wiebel & Wichmann. The data were presented at the "Tagung experimentell arbeitender Psychologen" in 2007.

Five observers participated in a temporal 2-AFC plaid masking experiment
(Wiebel & Wichmann, 2007); observers received auditory trial-by-trial feedback
about whether or not their response was correct.  After practice sessions, the
observers performed between 3 255 and 4 100 trials. In these trials, the
signal stimulus was randomly assigned to one of the two intervals,
independently of all other trials. In total, 18 305 trials from this
experiment were analysed.

Here is a brief description of these data.

Data are N x 9, with typically N = 50, that is one trial per row.
iv. Columns
1 - "truth": "1" if signal in first interval, "2" if signal in second.
2 - subject response: "1" for first, "2" for second, "3" for wrong button
press
3 - RT in seconds
4 - phase of signal in first interval (= 0 if signal not present)
5 - phase of mask component one in first interval
6 - phase of mask component two in first interval
7 - phase of signal in second interval (= 0 if signal not present)
8 - phase of mask component one in second interval
9 - phase of mask component two in second interval
