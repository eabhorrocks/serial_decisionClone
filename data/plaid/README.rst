"Five observers participated in a temporal 2-AFC plaid masking experiment
(Wiebel & Wichmann, 2007); observers received auditory trial-by-trial feedback
about whether or not their response was correct.  After practice sessions, the
observers performed between 3 255 and 4 100 trials. In these trials, the
signal stimulus was randomly assigned to one of the two intervals,
independently of all other trials. In total, 18 305 trials from this
experiment were analysed."

These data are provided as a matrix with colums
block condition stimulus target response
that can used by the ColumnData class.
