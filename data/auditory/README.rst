In our paper, we describe these data as follows:

"Six observers performed a single-interval (yes-no) auditory tone in noise
detection experiment. Each observer performed between 25 to 33 sessions. The
initial 7 to 12 sessions were used for training and only the remaining 18 to 22
sessions were analysed. Data were collected in blocks of 50 to 60 trials.  If a
particular trial contained a signal or not was independent of all other trials.
Observers received single-trial feedback for the first 10 trials of each block,
and we therefore discarded these trials. For each observer, between 20 610 and
22 800 trials were analysed resulting in a total of 127 430 trials."

These data are provided as a matrix with colums
block condition stimulus target response
that can used by the ColumnData class.
