In our paper, we describe these data as follows:

"Five observers had to detect luminance increments in different fields of
Adelsonâ€™s checkerboard illusion (Maertens & Wichmann, 2012) (for a description
of the paradigm (Maertens & Wichmann, 2013)). Each observer performed between 2
448 and 3 204 temporal 2-AFC trials and received only overall feedback after
blocks of 36 trials, i.e. the average performance over 36 trials. Each 36-trial
block contained 18 trials for each of the 2-AFC stimulus orderings, in a
randomly shuffled trial order. As our permutation test applied to this data
would also have a fixed number of alternatives in the null-distribution, it
will also work correctly if blocks are constructed by shuffling rather than by
sampling from a binomial distribution.  In total, 14 256 trials from this
experiment were analysed."
